          UPDATE: Tech Itch was not able to perform at this event due to a family emergency. We wish Mark and his family all the best and look forward to his return to San Francisco at a later date.
Tri-Atom &amp;amp; AfterGlow Events presents a special multi-genre event featuring DNB/Jungle/DubStep/House/Breaks/Electronica/Hardstyle/Psytrance/Trance/Happycore/Hardcore/Gabber and other forms of electronic dance music. You can find out more about the other types of music by clicking on the official event website but here at junglecode, you know what we’re all about, and we’re super-excited to see the return of Technical Itch to San Francisco.

          This is the third year of the annual junglecode 420 event, and with the global economy in the tank, we had our doubts about the feasibility of doing another one. Well, with a LOT of help from our friends at PROJECT 51 and SHELTER, we are so happy to bring back GRIDLOK all the way from Los Angeles to headline the show on Tuesday, April 21 at Underground SF in San Francisco.

          Almost 3 years ago, we presented our first major drum &amp;amp; bass event in San Francisco at the Underground SF. This time, we team up with MC DUH and the SHELTER crew to bring you A.Sides all the way from London, UK.
A Sides has been producing music since 1990 and has released over 500 tracks to date. He established his own label Eastside Records in 1996 and since then has remained a consistent figure within the drum and bass scene.

Our first 2009 show will stay true to our original charter: 100% World-Class Drum &amp;amp; Bass. We’ve been trying to book this DJ/Producer for some time now, and the planets finally line up to bring us KLUTE, the boss from Commercial Suicide, all the way from London, UK. This will surely be a stormer!

For this time only, we are having the party at the Matador club on 6th Street in downtown San Francisco. We’re also flying in our favorite (former) SF resident DJ GRIDLOK (Project 51, Violence Recordings) to headline this event. We’ll have other DJ’s on deck to ensure a blazing good time so come on down and celebrate the harvest with us.

          The San Francisco Bay Area institution that is FutureBreaks.FM recently announced the end of their long running Drum&amp;amp;Bass radio show after 10 years on the air. JUNGLECODE crew were fortunate enough to play on one of the last FutureBreaks shows last November.
We are a bit saddened to hear of the end of the radio broadcast but are encouraged to hear that the FutureBreaks crew plan to keep their web site updated with their future activities which include podcasts of FutureBreaks shows from the past and future.

Digital aka Steve Carr is the primary musical moniker this Ipswich based producer is known exclusively for his “old skool beatz” and “dubby B-lines” but a short conversation and a little investigative listening indicate this is one producer likely to pull a few seriously weighty tricks out of the bag.

          We remain dedicated to promoting the junglist spirit in music, art, and technology. For this installment of the junglecode monthly event, we originally planned to present the debut SF appearance of CURRENT VALUE. Due to circumstances beyond our control, he had to cancel his entire US tour at the last minute. In order to maintain the high standard of quality that our junglists expect at our shows, we called in ample reinforcements that can effectively maintain proper dubplate pressure.

          COUNTERSTRIKE
[ Algorythm:Human:Evol Intent:Obscene:Barcode:Outbreak:Moving Shadow – South Africa ]
Counterstrike has played an instrumental role in putting South Africa on the world drum ‘n bass map. Justin Scholtemeyer AKA Animal Chin and Eaton Crous AKA 500 Mills, have been active drum ‘n bass DJ’s on the club/rave circuit since the mid Nineties. Counterstrike has been producing drum ‘n bass as a collective since 1998. “We work together because we are into the same type of sound… it does not matter if we did a track together or seperately… it still sounds like Counterstrike.

In the last year, Jet has performed with several world-class Drum &amp;amp; Bass leaders including Loxy &amp;amp; Ink, Dylan, Chase &amp;amp; Status, Limewax, Hive, SPL, UFO! and TeeBee.
Also performing on Friday are DJ’s Gringo, Advance, and Audio1. This should be a really fun event with lots of different styles represented.

          If you haven’t been asleep during the last year or so, you may have noticed that we’ve been bringing the headliners from the world-famous Therapy Sessions to San Francisco. Well, we’re just getting started. Our next installment for Therapy Sessions SF will be led by none other than SPL (Lost Soul, Tech Itch, Freak, Evol Intent.) Please seek advice from your physician prior to attending this event if you are prone to weakness.

Details are still getting firmed up, but the date is set and 100 percent confirmed. Ask for your vacation days now, because you will need them after Dylan is through with you.

          March 14, 2006 was Pi Day in San Francisco and all over the cosmos. To celebrate this important value, junglecode teamed up with PHUTURO to bring these two awesome DJ/Producers to San Francisco on that evening at the Underground SF. We even gave away a bunch of Ink &amp;amp; Loxy records (which would not exist where it not for the discovery of the ratio of a circle’s diameter to its circumference.

          DJ Hive was headlining the weekly Phuturo night last Tuesday, December 13, 2005. The junglists of San Francisco are so fortunate to have such heavy hitters living and making music in the city. It was clear that the local crowd wanted to hear the latest dubplates and DJ Hive did not disappoint. Watch out for the Human Violence tour featuring Hive and Dieselboy — it’s going to be Heavy!

DJ Spirit is moving Inneractive Music in a big way with a brand-new web site and fresh beats. The new site is a work in progress and is sure to evolve over time (as Spirit himself has done effectively.

          The SF jungle scene is about to get a dose of some very heavy drum and bass from none other than acclaimed producers Digital &amp;amp; Spirit, making an appearance at Phuturo in November and December. Both of these artists have individually, and in collaboration as Phantom Audio, pioneered the sound we now associate with UK Drum &amp;amp; Bass. Don’t make the stupid mistake of missing either of these artists as they come into our neighborhood.

There’s no way we’d miss an opportunity to see and hear some of the most wicked beats on earth, so we trek down to Westminster to the ZenOne crew’s party at Bleu. Big UP to Dylan for rocking it in the O.

          Well, we do. We care enough to spread a significant bit of junglist history for the curious. The junglecode crew would like to publicly thank the pioneers from back in the day.
The infamous “Amen” break that inspired thousands of DnB tunes was originally recorded by the Winstons in the late sixties. The equally important “Apache” break was recorded by the Incredible Bongo Band in the early seventies. Interestingly, their version of “Apache” was also a cover of an original song performed by Bert Weedon in 1960.

          I went to see Dylan and Technical Itch play a few weeks ago at the subscience event in San Francisco. Dylan’s web site, freak-recordings.com, is easily my favorite drum and bass website right now. He uses Flash too, so it’s quite a thrill for me…like he’s playing my dubplates or something.
