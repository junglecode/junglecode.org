<p>UPDATE: Tech Itch was not able to perform at this event due to a family emergency. We wish Mark and his family all the best and look forward to his return to San Francisco at a later date.</p>
<p>Tri-Atom &amp; AfterGlow Events presents a special multi-genre event featuring DNB/Jungle/DubStep/House/Breaks/Electronica/Hardstyle/Psytrance/Trance/Happycore/Hardcore/Gabber and other forms of electronic dance music. You can find out more about the other types of music by clicking on <a href="http://www.brproductions.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=16186">the official event website</a> but here at junglecode, you know what we’re all about, and we’re super-excited to see the return of Technical Itch to San Francisco.</p>
<p>Labeled by his fans as ” the Dark Don of Drum and Bass”, Mark Caro, aka Technical Itch has infiltrated the masses worldwide with dark sound for over a decade.</p>
<p>It all started in the English town of Birmingham back in 1991, Mark was DJing at local parties and with a very limited set-up started tinkering about on the production trail. As his talent and musical production skills developed Mark’s set-up became more professional. He then started releasing tracks as ENTT through the Ibiza label. By that time Mark and Darren Beale ( aka Decoder- now member of band Kosheen) formed a partnership and released the first Plasmic Life EP that appeared on the Brain imprint.</p>
<p>Further releases ensued, but Mark had the desire to set up his own label, therefore in 1993 Technical Itch Recordings was launched. From the beginning the label was a success, especially with the support of Kenny Ken who played a selection of Technical Itch tracks on Kiss FM.</p>
<p>As a result of hard work and radio exposure, Technical Itch was signed to Moving Shadow Imprint and Mark’s label was then renamed, Tech Itch Recordings. By this time Mark was resettled in Bristol and his partnership with Decoder continued to develop in the studio.</p>
<p>Over the years Tech Itch Recordings have played an influential part in the worldwide Drum and Bass scene. Mark is widely renowned for his genius level of production and programming. His original tracks have pushed the bar in Drum and Bass because of their unique cinematic style, heavy bass stabs and of course the ever present amen break.</p>
<p>With 2006 seeing the 50th release on the Tech Itch label and up to 25 releases on sister label, Penetration- it is apparent that Mark’s stronghold over the Drum and Bass community is without question. Technical Itch is easily one of the most sought after heralded producers in the scene. He is the most in-demand DJ on Anger Management’s roster, playing nearly every weekend in the UK and Europe, along with frequent tours throughout the United States with Circle Management.</p>
