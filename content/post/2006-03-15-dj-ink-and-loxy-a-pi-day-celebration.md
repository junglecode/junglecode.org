March 14, 2006 was [Pi Day in San Francisco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Day) and all over the cosmos. To celebrate this important value, junglecode teamed up with [PHUTURO ](http://www.phuturo.com/)to bring these two awesome DJ/Producers to San Francisco on that evening at the [Underground SF](http://www.sfstation.com/business.php?blId=4846). We even gave away a bunch of Ink & Loxy records (which would not exist where it not for the discovery of the ratio of a circle’s diameter to its circumference.) Tons of fun for all who attended the event. Many thanks to the PHUTURO crew for hosting–you guys rock our world!
