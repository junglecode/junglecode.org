The SF jungle scene is about to get a dose of some very heavy drum and bass from none other than acclaimed producers Digital & Spirit, making an appearance at [Phuturo](http://www.phuturo.com) in November and December. Both of these artists have individually, and in collaboration as [Phantom Audio](http://www.lowerdepths.com/), pioneered the sound we now associate with UK Drum & Bass. Don’t make the stupid mistake of missing either of these artists as they come into our neighborhood. Let’s show them a proper welcome at [Phuturo](http://www.phuturo.com) on November 15 and December 6. See you there!

A very special acknowledgement is in order for SF’s own [DJ Juju](http://www.myspace.com/jujutek) for keeping Phuturo running for the last 7 years and bringing these monumental artists to San Francisco.
