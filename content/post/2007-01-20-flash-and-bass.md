What do these websites have in common?

<http://www.reinforcedrecords.co.uk/>  
<http://www.photekproductions.com/>  
<http://www.bigbadbass.com/>  
<http://www.freak-recordings.com>  
<http://www.breakbeat.co.uk/>

They all run Adobe Flash.

junglecode founder Jethro “Jet” Villegas is Sr. Engineering Manager at <s>Macromedia</s> Adobe and an architect of the Flash product. It’s not an accident that the software can handle Heavy Bass — it’s designed to do that and so much more. If you’re thinking about making a killer website, please consider using [Flash](http://www.adobe.com/flash/) and help keep the bass moving across the planet. Thank You.
