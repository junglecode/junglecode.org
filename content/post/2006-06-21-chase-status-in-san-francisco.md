junglecode is extremely proud to present Chase and Status \[ BBK | BC Presents | Bingo | UK \] for their first ever [San Francisco appearance](http://groundscore.net/board/viewtopic.php?t=22600) at [PHUTURO](http://groundscore.net/board/viewtopic.php?t=22759) on June 20, 2006. Do not sleep on this one because “first ever” only happens once. This duo has been tearing up the drum & bass circuit with dubplate rotation from the likes of Andy C, Mampi Swift, Friction, Zinc, Pendulum, Fabio and Bad Company all showing huge support for their releases.

The junglecode residents will reinforce the evening as well so don’t be late. This is another five dollar massive so look under those couch cushions for loose change and come out for some proper junglecode business.
