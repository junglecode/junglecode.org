This month we are offering an extended set from Company Truck @ junglecode on 4 turntables and 2 CD-J’s! It’s time to break in our new 1200Mk5G’s and who better to do it than these local heavies. These guys always bring the heat in a big way!

Also on deck for this fine payday evening, local support from the Sunset District…
