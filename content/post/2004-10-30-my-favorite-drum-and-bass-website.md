I went to see Dylan and Technical Itch play a few weeks ago at the [subscience](http://www.subscience.org) event in San Francisco. Dylan’s web site, [freak-recordings.com](http://www.freak-recordings.com), is easily my favorite drum and bass website right now. He uses Flash too, so it’s quite a thrill for me…like he’s playing my dubplates or something.
