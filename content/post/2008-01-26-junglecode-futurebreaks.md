The San Francisco Bay Area institution that is FutureBreaks.FM [recently announced](http://www.futurebreaks.fm/blog/) the end of their long running Drum&Bass radio show after 10 years on the air. [JUNGLECODE crew](http://www.futurebreaks.fm/blog/junglecode-november-10th-2007/) were fortunate enough to play on one of the last FutureBreaks shows last November.

We are a bit saddened to hear of the end of the radio broadcast but are encouraged to hear that the FutureBreaks crew plan to keep [their web site](http://www.futurebreaks.fm/blog/) updated with their future activities which include podcasts of FutureBreaks shows from the past and future.

Big Up FutureBreaks!
