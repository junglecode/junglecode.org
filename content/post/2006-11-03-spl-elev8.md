If you haven’t been asleep during the last year or so, you may have noticed that we’ve been bringing the headliners from the world-famous [Therapy Sessions](http://angeruk.net/therapy/) to San Francisco. Well, we’re just getting started. Our next installment for Therapy Sessions SF will be led by none other than [SPL](http://www.myspace.com/soundpressurelevels) (Lost Soul, Tech Itch, Freak, Evol Intent.) Please seek advice from your physician prior to attending this event if you are prone to weakness. This will be a costume party so start getting ready. There will be giveaways and other surprises for those properly (or improperly) dressed.
