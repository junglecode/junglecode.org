Well, we do. We care enough to spread a significant bit of junglist history for the curious. The junglecode crew would like to publicly thank the pioneers from back in the day.

The infamous [“Amen” break](https://www.junglecode.com/mp3s/the_winstons_Amen_Brother.mp3) that inspired thousands of DnB tunes was originally recorded by the Winstons in the late sixties. The equally important [“Apache” break](https://www.junglecode.com/mp3s/incredible_bongo_band_apache.mp3) was recorded by the Incredible Bongo Band in the early seventies. Interestingly, their version of “Apache” was also a cover of an original song performed by Bert Weedon in 1960.
