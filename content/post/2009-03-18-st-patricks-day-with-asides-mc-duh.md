[![](http://www.junglecode.com/images/blog/web_flyers/asides_thumb.jpg)](http://groundscore.net/board/viewtopic.php?t=44746)  
Almost 3 years ago, we presented [our first major drum & bass event](http://groundscore.net/board/viewtopic.php?t=19954) in San Francisco at the [Underground SF](http://www.sfstation.com/business.php?blId=4846). This time, we team up with MC DUH and the SHELTER crew to bring you A.Sides all the way from London, UK.

A Sides has been producing music since 1990 and has released over 500 tracks to date. He established his own label Eastside Records in 1996 and since then has remained a consistent figure within the drum and bass scene. Eastside has now released over 75 releases plus 2 compilation albums (Eastside Jamz Vol 1 & Vol.2) as well as A Sides solo album “Follow The Groove”

A Sides has had his material released on many other labels such as Metalheadz, Valve, True Playaz, Bingo, Innerground, Reinforced, Advanced, Liq-weed Ganja, Hospital and many more.
