We had a blast at [last year’s junglecode 420 event](http://www.junglecode.org/2007/04/420-harvest-celebration.html) so we’re doing it again!

For this time only, we are having the party at the Matador club on 6th Street in downtown San Francisco. We’re also flying in our favorite (former) SF resident DJ GRIDLOK (Project 51, Violence Recordings) to headline this event. We’ll have other DJ’s on deck to ensure a blazing good time so come on down and celebrate the harvest with us.

Also on deck:

(Autopsy vs CH)
