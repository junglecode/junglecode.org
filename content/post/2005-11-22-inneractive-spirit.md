junglecode crew would like to thank DJ Spirit for blowing the roof off [Phuturo](http://www.phuturo.com) last week. He played an excellent mix of his own dancefloor-smashing anthems along with some wickedness weâ€™ve never heard before. A solid 2-hour set!

DJ Spirit is moving Inneractive Music in a big way with a [brand-new web site](http://www.myspace.com/inneractive) and fresh beats. The new site is a work in progress and is sure to evolve over time (as Spirit himself has done effectively.)

junglecode tip: If you like hearing music on [myspace.com](http://www.myspace.com), be sure to [download the latest Flash Player 8.](http://www.macromedia.com/software/flashplayer/) The audio and video quality is much-improved in the new player and should reduce the buffering times.
