Wow! Another jungle DJ mix recorded at the junglecode studio last May. You’re in for a real treat this time. This one is an exclusive set from DJ Search One of San Francisco, California.

This set is all killer and no filler! Try [this link](https://www.junglecode.com/mp3s/search1_junglecode_05_15_04.m3u) first, if it doesn’t work, use [this one](https://www.junglecode.com/mp3s/search1_junglecode_05_15_04.mp3). (MP3 format)

DJ Search One has been part of the junglecode crew since we started back in 1998. A true junglist from the heart! He is currently making and breaking waves in Hilo, Hawaii. We hope to have him back in San Francisco in time for the Summer Sessions at Ocean Beach. I’ll post up the party info when it gets warmer. Bring the firewood!
