[<span style="font-weight: bold">COUNTERSTRIKE</span>](http://www.algorythmrecordings.com/cs.html)  
\[ Algorythm:Human:Evol Intent:Obscene:Barcode:Outbreak:Moving Shadow – South Africa \]

Counterstrike has played an instrumental role in putting South Africa on the world drum ‘n bass map. Justin Scholtemeyer AKA Animal Chin and Eaton Crous AKA 500 Mills, have been active drum ‘n bass DJ’s on the club/rave circuit since the mid Nineties. Counterstrike has been producing drum ‘n bass as a collective since 1998. “We work together because we are into the same type of sound… it does not matter if we did a track together or seperately… it still sounds like Counterstrike.”

This is an exclusive event presented by junglecode and Anger Management.
