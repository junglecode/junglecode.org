junglecode founder [Jet](http://www.myspace.com/jethrovillegas) performs on [Friday, November 17, 2006 at BLEND](http://www.groundscore.net/board/viewtopic.php?t=27130), a very bass-heavy weekly event in San Francisco. In the last year, Jet has performed with several world-class Drum & Bass leaders including Loxy & Ink, Dylan, Chase & Status, Limewax, Hive, SPL, UFO! and TeeBee.

Also performing on Friday are DJ’s Gringo, Advance, and Audio1. This should be a really fun event with lots of different styles represented. Come on through…
