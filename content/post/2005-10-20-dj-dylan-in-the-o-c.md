junglecode crew took a trip to Orange County to participate in the [Macromedia MAX](http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/events/max/) conference. As if the stars lined up in the cosmos, [DJ Dylan](http://www.freak-recordings.com/) is in Orange County as well. There’s no way we’d miss an opportunity to see and hear some of the most wicked beats on earth, so we trek down to Westminster to the ZenOne crew’s party at Bleu. Big UP to Dylan for rocking it in the O.C. Another big UP to the O.C. junglists who welcomed us in.
