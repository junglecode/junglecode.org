If you find yourself on the Big Island of Hawaii, you can now enjoy some [junglecode on FM radio](http://radio.uhh.hawaii.edu/show-info/?id=31&show_name=junglecode) from 2 to 4 PM on Thursdays (Hawaii time.) Big up to DJ Search One for broadcasting in the 808 area code. If you’re not in Hawaii, you can hear the [web stream](http://radio.uhh.hawaii.edu/show-info/?id=31&show_name=junglecode) on the University of Hawaii server. If that doesn’t work, you’ll have to catch a plane to Hawaii to hear the broadcast. One more reason to escape to a remote island for some jungle.
