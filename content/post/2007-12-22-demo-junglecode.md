Seattle’s Demo could be called an overnight success, but only if that night lasted eleven years. A founding member of the 360BPM crew, Demo promoted one of the longest-running DnB weeklies and had a huge hand in the inception and growth of Seattle’s Drum and Bass scene. Years of warming up the decks for some of the biggest acts in Drum and Bass and countless hours in the studio proved fruitful when Barcode’s 2005 releases of “Us Against the World” and “Gorilla Taktiks” with Infiltrata catapulted Demo to new heights. His latest release, Human Imprint’s “Ladies Night” with production partner Cease, has been called “one of the absolute sickest Human releases to date” by label owner Dieselboy and has received overwhelming support by Drum and Bass’ heaviest hitters.

Caned by everyone from Andy C and Grooverider to Dieselboy and Shy FX, the controversial Ladies Night has been licensed for 4 mixed CDs, including Andy C’s 10 Years of Drum and Bass compilation for Drum and Bass Arena. With a steady stream of well-received tunes and spectacular behind the deck skills, you can definitely see why Demo definitely has Crowd Control!
